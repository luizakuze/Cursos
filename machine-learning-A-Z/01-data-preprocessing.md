# Data Pre-Processing Steps

1) Data Pre-Processing : Import the data, clean the data and split into training and test sets.
2) Modelling: Build the model, train the model and make predictions.
3) Evaluation: Calculate performance metrics and make a verdict.

## Feature Scalling
- Examples: Normalization and Standardization.
- To find which sample is most similar to the other.

1) Normalization: X` = (X - Xmin) / (Xmax - Xmin). [0;1]
2) Standardization X` = (X - mean) / standard deviation. [-3;3]
